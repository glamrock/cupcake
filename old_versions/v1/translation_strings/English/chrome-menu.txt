Cupcake
Status:
What your status means
Working: if your status is light blue or dark blue, your proxy is running.
Dark blue means the proxy is running but no one is using it right now.
Light blue means someone is using your proxy right now. Neat!
Not working: if your status is grey or black, there was a problem and your proxy is not running.
Gray means that the badge has disabled itself. Try restarting your browser. If the problem persists, you might not be able to use Cupcake with this computer.
Black means that there was an internal error and the proxy is no longer running. Try restarting your browser.
