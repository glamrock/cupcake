Cupcake helps censored people access the web using Tor, by creating bridges for the internet's most censored users.

If you are being censored, please install the full Tor Browser Bundle. Cupcake can't bypass censorship on its own!

The Tor Project helps people overcome censorship. If you aren't familiar with Tor, please read up on it before installing Cupcake. More info: https://torproject.org

But it means that you don't have to run the entire Tor software suite if you only want to make bridges. It's also the only way (currently) to create a Tor bridge if you are a Chrome OS user.
